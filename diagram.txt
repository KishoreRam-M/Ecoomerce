1. Use Case Diagram
Purpose: Helps to understand the functionality that the system will provide from the perspective of the user (or other systems).

Best for: Product architecture, especially when you're mapping out features and user interactions.

Example Use: Visualizing the different roles and interactions between users and the system (e.g., customer places order, admin manages orders).

Tool: Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, draw.io.

2. Class Diagram
Purpose: Shows the static structure of the system, including classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

Best for: Understanding the product's underlying software structure and the relationships between different components/classes in an object-oriented design.

Example Use: Mapping out the domain model, such as Order, OrderItem, and Product classes, their properties, and how they interact.

Tool: PlantUML, Visual Paradigm, draw.io.

3. Sequence Diagram
Purpose: Shows how objects interact in a particular sequence of events, focusing on the message passing between objects.

Best for: Understanding the flow of control and data between different components of your system, especially useful for detailing interactions in processes like placing an order or updating order status.

Example Use: Visualizing the interactions between the user, the order service, and the product database when a customer places an order.

Tool: PlantUML, Lucidchart, draw.io.

4. Component Diagram
Purpose: Shows the physical or logical components of the system and their dependencies. This is useful for high-level architecture.

Best for: Representing how different parts of the product are structured and how they communicate (e.g., microservices, backend components, third-party APIs).

Example Use: Illustrating the various services in a microservices architecture and their dependencies (e.g., OrderService, InventoryService, PaymentGateway).

Tool: Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, draw.io.

5. Deployment Diagram
Purpose: Shows how the system will be deployed on hardware or cloud infrastructure, including the physical nodes and communication paths between them.

Best for: Representing the physical deployment of the system in a specific environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

Example Use: Mapping out how different services (database, application server, load balancers) are distributed in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes clusters).

Tool: Lucidchart, Visual Paradigm, draw.io.

6. Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
Purpose: Shows how entities in the system (such as tables in a database) relate to each other.

Best for: Product architecture, especially when designing or understanding your database schema.

Example Use: Visualizing the relationships between entities like Order, Product, Customer, and how they link via foreign keys.

Tool: dbdiagram.io, draw.io, Lucidchart.

7. Flowchart
Purpose: Represents a process in the system using various types of boxes and arrows to show steps and decision points.

Best for: Mapping out specific workflows or processes in the system (e.g., user registration, order placement).

Example Use: Visualizing the process flow for order fulfillment or user authentication.

Tool: Lucidchart, draw.io, Cacoo.

8. Activity Diagram
Purpose: Describes the workflow of the system, including decision points, parallel activities, and the overall flow of processes.

Best for: Modeling business processes and system workflows, such as the lifecycle of an order or user interaction with the system.

Example Use: Illustrating the steps involved in processing an order, from cart checkout to payment confirmation and shipping.

Tool: Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, draw.io.

9. State Diagram (State Machine Diagram)
Purpose: Depicts the various states an object can be in and how it transitions from one state to another based on events.

Best for: Modeling state-dependent processes (e.g., order processing).

Example Use: Showing the different states of an order (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered) and how it transitions based on actions (e.g., status updates).

Tool: PlantUML, Visual Paradigm, draw.io.
